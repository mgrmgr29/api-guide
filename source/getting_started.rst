Getting Started
===============

Useful Links:

* `API spec`_ - The API specification.
* `sandbox`_ - Our sandbox environment for testing.

To start using our API you first need to crate an account on our `sandbox`_
environment. Ensure that both your email and mobile number have been validated.

From here you can manually create test trades through the sandbox site to get an
idea of how the process works.

To get your API key send a request to `support`_ once approved you can then
:doc:`generate your API key </create_key>`.
